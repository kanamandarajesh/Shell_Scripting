| `rm`    | The command to run (in this case, **remove/delete** the file).                                               |

## üß™ **Examples of `find`**

### 1. üîç **Find Files by Name**


find . -name "file.txt"

---

### 2. üóÇÔ∏è **Find All `.log` Files in /var/log**


find /var/log -type f -name "*.log"


---

### 3. üßπ **Delete Temporary Files**


find /tmp -type f -name "*.tmp" -exec rm {} \;


---

### 4. üì¶ **Find Large Files (> 100MB)**


find / -type f -size +100M


---

### 5. ‚è±Ô∏è **Find Files Modified in the Last 7 Days**


find . -type f -mtime -7


---

### 6. üì§ **Copy Recently Changed Files to Backup**


find /home/user/docs -type f -mtime -1 -exec cp {} /home/user/backup/ \;


---

## üí° **Pro Tips**

* Use `\;` to end `-exec` commands.
* Use `+` instead of `\;` with `-exec` to execute the command on **multiple files at once** (faster):


find . -name "*.log" -exec rm {} +


* Combine conditions:


find . -type f \( -name "*.log" -o -name "*.txt" \)
